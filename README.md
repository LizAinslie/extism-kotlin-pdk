> [!NOTE]  
> This project is still in development! Tread lightly when using it as is, as its API is subject to change.

**What's provided so far:**
- WASM bindings to common Extism calls

**What's left to add:**
- Plugin definitions (probably in the form of annotations)
  - If using annotations, an annotation processor to inline the proper code for each plugin-defined object
- A beautiful Kotlin DSL for defining plugins âœ¨
